## Inspiration

When I'm working on a computer, I usually like to have live streams or videos running in the background or in a small window on the side. I don't really want to go out of my way to pick what I want to watch, so I decided to create my own streaming platform. I wanted to put a bunch of videos into it, and have it randomly select the content to play, showing what is up next once in a while just like some TV stations. However, my main goal for Comfy Channel was to have the little clock in the top left corner like you see on Japanese TV
